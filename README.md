# SHADERS

## Indroduce

HiðŸ‘Š,I'm from Turkey,and I do game development.
This project contains shader examples. I will share them here as I add more. If you have any questions about the project, you can contact me through my linkedin profile or my e-mail address.

## Day and Night Sky Shader

In this project I prepared the skybox with the shader graph. What makes the skybox different is that I can change the colors of the skybox at runtime. I also added to it the day&night cycle and the ability to manipulate the intensity of the shadow during the cycle.
